// dynamically load set of image urls (data) into cards
// change width, height, and number of cards displayed based on data (there should be a max #)
// close up spaces between cards based on position
// hovering over a card permanently (?) shifts that card to the center, and all other cards to the -direction of the hovered card (e.g. if card is on the left, it shifts the whole carousel right)
// clicking on a card (a second time?) goes to the page with that portfolio item (or flips card, in full npm version)
